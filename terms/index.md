Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Branduvo website (the "Service") operated by Branduvo Media LLC ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## 1. Content

Our Service allows you to read information and reviews about various products and services. The content found on or through this Service is the property of Branduvo Media LLC or used with permission.

## 2. Affiliate Disclosure

Branduvo participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on products purchased through our links to retailer sites. Our recommendations and reviews are based on our honest opinions and research, and the affiliate commission has no impact on the ranking or inclusion of products. Please see our [Affiliate Disclaimer](/affiliate-disclaimer) for more information.

## 3. User Comments

Certain parts of the Service may allow you to post comments, provide feedback, or submit suggestions ("Comments"). By posting Comments, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, translate, distribute, perform, and display such Comments in any medium.

You are responsible for the content of your Comments. Comments must not:

## 11. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.
