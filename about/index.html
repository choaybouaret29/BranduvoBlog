            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At Branduvo, we're on a mission to empower digital entrepreneurs and creative professionals with carefully curated tools and resources that drive real business growth.

        <section id="who-we-are">
            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2022, Branduvo emerged from a simple observation: digital entrepreneurs and creators were overwhelmed by choice but underwhelmed by guidance. Our team of digital marketing specialists, software developers, and content creators came together with a shared vision—to create a trusted resource that cuts through the noise.</p>
            <p>Our headquarters in London serves as the hub for our international team of experts who rigorously evaluate the tools and resources we recommend. With combined experience of over 50 years in digital entrepreneurship, our insights come from real-world application, not theoretical knowledge.</p>
